Just walked out of the theater, and wow, Honeymoon Crasher was… well, something else. You know that feeling when you’re kind of tired but your brain is still buzzing from whatever whirlwind just smacked you in the face? Yeah, that’s me right now. I swear, this   is like trying to untangle a slinky with boxing gloves on. 

First of all, who thought sticking a lone honeymoon suite in the middle of, what was it? A haunted lemon grove? could be romantic? I mean, there’s tension and then there’s just “let’s throw every chaotic mess into one vibe.” The script seemed like it was written by a caffeinated squirrel. One minute it’s all lovey-dovey, and the next, BAM! Enter the random uninvited ex with an accordion. And I kid you not, they gave him a monologue on existential dread while playing a polka.

The characters? Mixed bag of jellybeans. Some are sweet, some you want to spit out immediately. The lead duo was trying so hard to convince us they were in love that I almost believed them… almost. There’s passionate, and then there’s this weird lingering awkwardness, like seeing a couple fight over who left the milk out but they’re doing it with baby voices. Yikes.

> Then there’s that crazy plot twist with the time-traveling wedding planner, oh lord. I’m sitting there thinking, who slipped Doctor Who into my rom-com? And, dear director, if you’re listening, maybe dial down the fog machine. It looked like a fog convention had accidentally gate-crashed the honeymoon.

Was it worth the 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩? Maybe. It’s like one of those 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦 trial  s you might 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 for a rainy day. But hey, the soundtrack slapped, and the accidental llama cameo is pure gold. And at least I got to practice my “what on earth am I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨” face. 

// Function for crashing honeymoons, slightly broken
function honeymoonCrash() {
    let chaos = document.getElementById(plot);
    while (chaos) {
        scream++;
    }
}

Bottom line, if you’re into the idea of a rom-com fever dream mashed with bizarre logic and oddball charm, give it a go. Who knows? Maybe you’ll find the accordion player oddly relatable. Strange little 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮, and I kind of hope they make a sequel just to see how much weirder it can get. But for now, I’m bracing myself for the incoming wave of “Why did you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 that?” texts from my friends.
